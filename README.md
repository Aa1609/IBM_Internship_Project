## Project Overview

In an era where online reviews shape consumer choices, understanding customer sentiment is paramount. Our project harnesses the power of natural language processing (NLP) to analyze restaurant reviews and classify them as positive or negative. What sets us apart is our tailored approach, real-time functionality, and commitment to user satisfaction.




## Features

* Multinomial Naive Bayes: Our primary modeling technique, known for its excellence in text classification tasks. 
* Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tuned our model's alpha parameter to achieve higher accuracy and precision. 
* Text Vectorization (CountVectorizer): This process converts text data into numerical features, capturing word frequencies to represent the reviews.
